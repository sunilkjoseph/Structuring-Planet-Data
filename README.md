# Solar System Planets Table

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to test comprehension of HTML tables and associated features, in alignment with the learning material provided in the [HTML Tables module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables) on MDN Web Docs. By completing this project, learners can reinforce their understanding of structuring HTML tables, using semantic elements, associating headers with rows/columns, and implementing basic styling.

## Project Overview

This project involves creating an HTML data table to display facts and figures about the planets in our solar system. The data is sourced from the `planets-data.txt` file, and the table is designed to be informative and easy to follow for students studying the planets.

## Table Structure

The HTML table is organized with the following structure:

- Outer container
- Table header with column headers
- Table body with rows containing planet data

## Steps to Complete the Table

1. **Outer Container, Table Header, and Table Body:**
   - The HTML document starts with an outer container, a table header, and a table body.
   - The table header includes columns for the planet's name, mass, diameter, density, gravity, length of day, distance from the Sun, mean temperature, number of moons, and notes.

2. **Caption:**
   - The table includes a caption providing information about the source of the planetary facts.

3. **Header Row:**
   - The first row in the table header is dedicated to column headers.
   - The first cell of the header row is left blank and spans two columns.

4. **Content Rows:**
   - Rows inside the table body represent individual planets.
   - Each row includes semantically marked headings and corresponding data cells.

5. **Association Attributes:**
   - Attributes are added to ensure unambiguous association between headers and their respective rows/columns.

6. **Column Border:**
   - A black border is added around the column containing planet names to enhance visibility.

## CSS Styling

The `minimal-table.css` file provides simple styling for the table, including borders, padding, and alternating row colors for better readability.

## Data Source

The data used in this project is sourced from [NASA's Planetary Fact Sheet - Metric](http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/).

## Additional Information

- The `README.md` file provides an overview of the project.
- The `planets-data.txt` file contains the raw data used to populate the table.
- This project is completed as part of the assessment in the learning material provided in the [HTML Tables module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables) on MDN Web Docs.
